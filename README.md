# VS Code Customizations

This repository contains custom CSS and JavaScript files that I used to customize my Visual Studio Code (VSCode) environment. While using the Catppuccin Frappe theme. Much of the code and inspiration was taken from the Glenn Raya and his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_I0bySQoCs) and [repo](https://github.com/glennraya/vscode-settings-json/tree/main).
